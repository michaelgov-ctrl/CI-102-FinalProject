[embedded youtube video with example goes here]
The first project for CI 102 is to create a presentation regarding a cyber security topic.

My team chose the ransomeware™. To provide a brief example of the functionality of ransomeware™ I've written a program that will either recursively encrypt or decrypt a target directory.

[usage]

-encrypt
    
    Pass to encrypt data

-target_directories string
    
    [required] Comma-separated list of directories to encrypt

-worker_count int
    
    Number of workers to encrypt/decrpyt with (default 5)
